Haha I finally remembered to stick a readme in with the download so people can actually install a modus without, like, prydyktyve magyks. Or just an understanding of Java I guess?

Anyhoo.

In this order:

adventuresofcaliborn.txt, one of the two text documents, goes in the SDECK/modi/items folder.

AdventuresOfCaliborn the folder, and AdventuresOfCalibornModus.class, the class file, both go in the SDECK/modi folder.

The other text file, AdventuresOfCalibornModus.txt, is the source code, in case you so desire to fiddle with the modus and/or are trying to learn how to code one yourself.
I probably ought to begin including that with all the other ones, too. You can stick it in modus-dev/src if you feel like it, or you could ignore it. It'll work either way.

Inside the folder, there's the image files the modus uses and some other superfluous stuff that you can delete if you want to conserve some space. The source code, and control-f, should be helpful in figuring out which ones are used and which aren't.




Congratulations, you can now use your brand new Adventures of Caliborn Modus.

If you haven't read it, you may find it to be entertaining, and also helpful in understanding why the cards are arranged like that. (Hint: It's Eridan's scarf, except with 75% more seizures)
